Hi dear Network,

Hope you’re doing well & Ramadan Karim to you All.

Almost a year now of my active research for a job, unfortunately i haven’t found one yet.
I have gained some experience in Automotive quality this past year during my internships, thanks to the quality team of Marelli SA.
I think i am more than ready now to start a new adventure and take over responsibilities and reach objectives and goals.

All im asking is a simple like or share that would help me get my first job. I thank you in advance.

Thank you for taking the time to read this post
